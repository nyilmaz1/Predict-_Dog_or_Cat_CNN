# Predict-_Dog_or_Cat_CNN
ML with keras
Convolutional Neural Network
predicting if a given picture is a cat or a dog.


This model has two convolution layers: test accuracy: 92, validation accuracy: 82. validation accuracy can be increased by adding additional layers, applying dropout and playing with the hyperparameters
